			<p>The swayer of the night but refined in the day. Only in a tavern brawl would you ever see these graceful devil's show there true colors with a blade.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A Dancer</h4>
			<p>When creating a dancer, think about your character’s background and purpose for dancing. Did they want to dance, or were they forced into it from circumstance? What drives your character to go beyond a normal dancer, and actually fight? Talk to your DM about the role dancers might have in your campaign's societies.</p>
			<p class="indent">Did you serve an apprenticeship, studying under a master, following the more experienced DANCER until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or did you attend a college where you studied DANCERic lore and practiced your musical magic? Perhaps you were a young runaway or orphan, befriended by a wandering DANCER who became your mentor. Or you might have been a spoiled noble child tutored by a master. Perhaps you stumbled into the clutches of a hag, making a bargain for a musical gift in addition to your life and freedom, but at what cost?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a dancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Charisma, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the entertainer background. Finally, choose a rapier, 2 daggers, an entertainer's pack, and a dancer's costume.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>

		<description>
			<p>At 2nd level, you have learned how to harness the power of your dancing, turning your wishes and wills into pure magic.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Dancer table.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Dancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the DANCER spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the DANCER table shows when you learn more DANCER spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the DANCER spells you know and replace it with another spell from the DANCER spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Dancer spells. Your magic comes from the beauty and elegance of your dancing and movements. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a dancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>You can cast any DANCER spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use a costume or a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your dancing spells.</p>

			<p>At 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind-influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn. During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit. The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).</p>

		<supports>DANCER College</supports>
		<description>
			<p>DANCERs of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these DANCERs use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>
			<p class="indent">The loyalty of these DANCERs lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a DANCER as a herald or advisor knows that the DANCER would rather be honest than politic.</p>
			<p class="indent">The college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>
