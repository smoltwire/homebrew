		<description>
			<p>The swayer of the night but refined in the day. Only in a tavern brawl would you ever see these graceful devil's show their true colors with a blade.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A DANCER</h4>
			<p>When creating a dancer, think about your character’s background and purpose for dancing. Did they want to dance, or were they forced into it from circumstance? What drives your character to go beyond a normal dancer, and actually fight? Talk to your DM about the role dancers might have in your campaign's societies.</p>
			<p class="indent">Did you serve under a master, following the more experienced dancer until you were ready to strike out on your own? Or were you entranced by a traveling performer, informally trained yet alluring all the same? Perhaps you were lost, uninspired by your current life and unsure about your prospects, when an unexpected mentor taught you the beauty of the moving body. Or you might have been the reserved child of a noble, deprived of the arts and forbidden from indulding in the indecent, lude practices of the rabble only to abandon your life of luxury for one of free will and grace. Perhaps you used your beauty to support your family, practicing the trade at the cost of your reputation only to find yourself suddenly free of obligation, of duty?</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>You can make a dancer quickly by following these suggestions. First, put your highest ability score in Charisma, followed by Dexterity. Second, choose the entertainer background. Finally, choose a rapier, 2 daggers, an entertainer's pack, and a dancer's costume.</p>

		<description>
			<p>At 2nd level, you have learned how to harness the power of your dancing, turning your wishes and wills into pure magic.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard spell list. You learn additional cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Dancer table.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Dancer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the Bard spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the dancer table shows when you learn more spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your dancer spells. Your magic comes from the beauty and elegance of your dancing and movements. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a dancer spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>You can cast any dancer spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use a costume or a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus for your dancing spells.</p>
